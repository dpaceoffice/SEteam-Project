Software development group project (Team-2)

Project Idea:
Chatbox (Desktop app)

This project is a multi-threaded chatbox with a client-server TCP networking protocol. It utilizes sqLite to create/store registered accounts and handles password encryption with the bCrypt hashing function. Designated clients are accompanied with GUI interfaces programmed using Java's Swing API. Currently the client supports a login and chatbox GUI.
